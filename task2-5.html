      <h1>
        A page with some divs and spans
      </h1>
      <p>
        This page looks much cleaner now that I've put my content in a div
        with a white background.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because this div is special, it has it's own id, "content". This allows
        us to differentiate it from other divs and give it a white background.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        This is a normal paragraph, except
        <span class="blue">this span of blue text</span>
        <span class="fancy">and this span has a font-family of cusrive,</span>
        because they belong to two classes called "blue" and "fancy" respectively
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, <span class="blue fancy">this span of text is both blue and fancy!</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        This text is inside a normal div, but the background has not been set.
